## Installation Live Stream

Implement http://agora.io by adding AgoraRtcKit, AgoraRtmKit, AgoraUIKit_iOS, AgoraVideoSwiftUI

### SPM
If you didn't find any of these kit in project please download package through `Package.swift`.

## Usage

### UIKit
Adding functionality in `AgoraVideoCanvasView.swift` using `AgoraVideoCanvasView`.
